      "message": "These Updating-This-Document.html files are generated during the build in the build-help.xml Ant task. The URL must be fixed there; I presume the edit you did there would also fix this URL.\n\nAnd why do we have the 5.1 N\u0026N here? Last release was 5.2, and I\u0027d expect this to contain the 5.3 N\u0026N when we do the 5.3 release.\n\nBTW, looks like your script missed the corresponding files in the EGit subfolder.",

      "message": "No script involved. I\u0027m unclear about the documentation. I thought that the files in the egit subfolder are created from the wiki, so I thought we either need to fix some links there or we just need to adapt the baseUrl property in the transformation script. I did neither, and wanted to clarify that first.\n\nTo my believe this change should be complete, except for egit documentation. And I would like to do that one independently, when I know better how to do that transformation.",
