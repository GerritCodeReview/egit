      "message": "Yes, you\u0027re right, it depends on the characters/font. I chose 3 because \"…\" can replace \"lll\" or \"iii\", so 3 characters looks like the worst case. The goal is that the ellipsized text is not longer than the non-ellipsized, so I think using the worst case is ok here.\n\nTo do this correctly, we would probably have to render the text and measure its length. Certain toolkits provide ellipsize functionality (e.g. Gtk+ through Pango), but I don\u0027t think SWT exposes this.",
