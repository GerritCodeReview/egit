      "message": "The correct OSGi way would probably be a OSGi service, extension points are Eclipse specific ;)\n\nBack to serious: yes, some mechanism like this would be the right way, but requires a lot more thinking about; what if there are two competing implementations, which to choose? priorities, overrides, ...? There may only be one implementation for a certain filter type, right? Also I would not want this to be LFS specific, but rather allow to contribut implementations for any filter type somehow - is this feasible in the first place?",
