I feel like I get such feedback mainly on trivial changes (regarding functionality), where I\u0027m cleaning up code of other developers, that should have been cleaned up before it was committed (i.e. when the warnings were introduced). It\u0027s like collecting trash on a public place, and still being criticized for not doing it right. :(",
