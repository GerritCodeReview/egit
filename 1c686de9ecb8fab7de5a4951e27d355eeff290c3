I don\u0027t think it is possible\nto run any remotely recent java or Git on that old Macs.\n\nIf so, only one replace would do the job more efficiently. After all\nthis is a utility that may be called from anywhere. I\u0027m not sure having constants for CRLF helps readbility here,\n\ns.replaceAll(\"\\r\\n?\",\"\\n\"); // replace any CRLFs or CRs\n\nI\u0027d prefer the one blow because if someone actually do get CR only, into their messages I\u0027d like to know and understand. Fixing\nhypotetical errors are often a source of unnecessary bugs, hard-to-maintain code and bad performance.\n\ns.replaceAll(\"\\r\\n\",\"\\n\"); // replace any CRLFs",
