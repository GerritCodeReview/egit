      "message": "Oops? Matthias, I\u0027m away from my computer now, so I can\u0027t check myself: does the \"Init Git Flow\" command not just display correctly but also actually _work_ on a Java project? Occurred to me just now... and I\u0027m not sure anymore.\n\nI changed this so that the menu entry would display correctly also for IJavaProject elements in the project explorer, but I suspect this needs a change in GitFlowHandlerUtil. Something like\n\n  Repository repository \u003d AdapterUtils.adapt(firstElement,\n\t\t\t\tRepository.class);\n  if (repository \u003d\u003d null) {\n    // Try harder :-)\n    IResource resource \u003d AdapterUtils.adapt(firstElement, IResource.class);\n    if (resource !\u003d null) {\n       repository \u003d AdapterUtils.adapt(resource, Repository.class);\n    }\n  }\n\nThe point is that the GitFlowAdapterFactory won\u0027t adapt an IJavaProject. Could you check, please? If not, I\u0027ll re-check tonight and if necessary post a follow-up change.",

I currently have 5 outgoing commits which will fix this and several other issues regarding command enablement.\nI yet have to test it thouroughly though.\nI\u0027ll push until the end of the week.",

      "message": "Ok, I\u0027ll leave it alone now. Looking forward to your patches. Stumbled over this in another context and had seen it was assigned to you since September, but still unresolved...\n\nI just couldn\u0027t leave this particular fix in a buggy state, so I did the change I had outlined above. Works nicely, and should be safe, since all GitFlow handlers (and only those) call this GitFlowHandlerUtil.\n\nJust a minor additional point (not fixed): \"Init Git Flow\" opens a dialog; the menu entry should thus IMO be \"Init Git Flow...\", and likewise for any other menu entries that result in dialogs requiring further user input.",
