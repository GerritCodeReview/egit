      "message": "I verified as best as I could that C git does write a zero timestamp, and doesn\u0027t make use of the field for conflict stages.\n\nIf C git ever starts using this timestamp, it will be !\u003d EPOCH, and EGit will simply fall back to not using stage 2 at all but the working tree file. Since it won\u0027t use stage 2, it\u0027ll also not modify the timestamp in the index.\n\nSo it should be safe; in the worst case, the user would not get shown stage 2, would file a bug, and we\u0027d have to figure out a different fix.\n\nNot that I know a different fix. I thought long and hard about this, and this was the only way I saw. Best would be if we had a stage 4 in the index, corresponding to the pre-merged working tree content, with proper timestamp. Then we could in the treewalk compare the OIDs from the FileTreeIterator and from index stage 4 to know whether the on-disk file has changed, and then use the on-disk file. But that would have to be done first in C git, and I suspect adding such a stage 4 would break older git implementations that expect at most 3 stages.",
