But Mars.0\n \u003e had 3.11.0.\n\nTrouble is, if we use the version numbers from X.0, but only test/develop with X.2 in the target platform, then we still have some untested range.\n\nI can understand that some users cannot upgrade between major versions due to restrictions on other plugins they require. However, I would want users to always upgrade to the latest service release available for their major version. If they don\u0027t even manage that (and sit on the lowest major version we support), I\u0027m okay with not supporting them.\n\nIf we want to officially support all the X.0 releases, then we should rewrite our TPD files, since they fetch the latest bundles.\n\nI should probably move this discussion to a bug, to enable everyone to expression his/her opinion about the support level.",

      "message": "Yes, this is caused by laziness and I agree we should fix this. Please fix it in a single commit if possible.\n\nI would assume that all platform bundles follow semantic versioning and that they don\u0027t do breaking changes in service releases, hence I don\u0027t see a reason why we should insist on 4.5.2 instead of 4.5.0 as the baseline for the lowest version we accept.\nI also would assume that anybody who wants a platform fix for 4.5 is probably the one who has to implement the fix.\n\nMaintenance statement for EGit [1] says that we support at least the last two platform releases and try to avoid breaking older releases if there is no good reason to do so. This means we do not promise to test releases older than the last 2 platform releases.\n\n[1] https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/FAQ#What_versions_of_Eclipse_does_EGit_target.3F",
