      "message": "For me it look\u0027s strange that somebody who was previously calling isIgnored() to find out whether a path is ignored is now guided to use a method \"canBeAutoIgnored()\". I like the new method canBeAutoIgnored() but I can imagine that in future we have more arguments why pathes should be auto-ignoreable or not. The fact whether a path is already in the ignored resources is only one argument.\n\nTherefore I would like to seperate the questions isIgnored() and canBeAutIgnored(). I suggest that we only update the javadoc of this method saying that it only works on existing pathes. In the end I think we need both methods.",
