      "message": "What this page could do and what the replacement can not is e.g. pushing a commit to \"refs/for/master\" or to any other specific ref. The Push Branch wizard simplifies this by design, so that users don\u0027t have to enter \"refs/heads/\".\n\nThis also had content assist. Users of the existing wizard won\u0027t like this.\n\nMaybe a way to incorporate this into the Push Branch page is by adding a button behind the branch text field with the label \"Ref\", which switches the meaning of the text field to be a arbitrary ref spec.. Or change the \"Branch:\" label into a dropdown where \"Ref:\" can be selected? Any ideas?\n\nOr keep the existing wizard for that use case?",
