      "message": "I know. :-) Don\u0027t you get blinking decorations now? On refresh, the decorator briefly disappears before it re-appears when the background decorator has done its job. Compare bug 130340; especially the last comment.\n\nAny idea how to avoid that? I\u0027d _love_ to have all these image decorations in the decorator, not in the label provider, but so far I haven\u0027t found a way to do so without this flickering. For label texts, there\u0027s this hyper-ugly work-around with appending a blank.",
