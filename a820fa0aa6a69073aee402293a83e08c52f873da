      "message": "I just thought that your (complete) code change looks like a perfect candidate for Java streams, since it is effectively a huge mapping and filtering. However, when I tried to write that code, I failed at the selected part. If I start with Stream.of(resources)..., then this instanceof-check seems impossible, since it would require an object from much earlier of my .filter.map.filter.map chain. Any ideas about that?\n\nNevertheless we can just merge your change, if you don\u0027t want to explore that territory. :)",

      "message": "I didn\u0027t analyze _why_ we get a null entry in that \"nodes\" array. Maybe we should do so. Off-hand, I don\u0027t see why there are two different maps for files and containers. Is that for file-folder conflicts? Otherwise how could there ever be a file and a folder with the same path? If we really can\u0027t have that, a single map would be sufficient, and then this distinction wouldn\u0027t be necessary, and a streams-based implementation would be straight-forward.\n\nBut while streams are sometimes nice I don\u0027t see any pressing need to rewrite this using streams. The code is clear enough as it is, and I don\u0027t think a stream would be more efficient.",
