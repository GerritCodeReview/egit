      "message": "what do you mean with \"collapses anything\" ? \n\nAt the moment the only action which stops auto-expand is \"collapse all\" using the toolbar button. But if I collapse some tree nodes in the tree they get again auto-expanded when new entries enter the respective tree. \n\nI\u0027d prefer if nodes I closed in e.g. the unstaged changes tree aren\u0027t reopened automatically when another file is modified or unstaged",

      "message": "More precisely, it should read \"collapses a node in the tree or presses Collapse All\".\n\nThe intent of this change is that it works as you describe, see addListenerToDisableAutoExpandOnCollapse. Maybe it\u0027s a platform-specific bug? The following works for me (tested just now):\n\n* Use the jgit repo with the compact tree representation\n* Change AddCommand so that it shows up in unstaged changes\n* Press Expand All\n* Change CanceledException \u003e the \"errors\" node should be automatically expanded\n* Collapse the \"error\" node\n* Change BlameGenerator\n\nNow the \"blame\" node should be there, but not be expanded. Also, change e.g. CheckoutConflictException, and errors should remain collapsed.\n\nIf that does not work for you, could you debug if disableAutoExpand is called when you collapse a node?",

Could you please debug the last step with a breakpoint in expandPreviousExpandedAndPaths and see what getAutoExpandLevel returns and what causes the expanded state to be changed?\n\nAlso note, what happens in your second step depends on whether the staged table was set to auto-expand before or not. If you press \"Expand All\" in staged changes before doing it, it should be expanded. If you press \"Collapse All\", it should stay collapsed.",
