      "message": "We can. I don\u0027t think it matters much, but somehow I had the feeling that doing it this way would traverse a less deep hierarchy than a pure depth-first search and thus be faster in cases where there are non-IN_SYNC files.\n\nEven better would be of course to either not have such folders in this GitSyncObjectTree, or have them have a ThreeWayDiffEntry that is already marked as IN_SYNC. But that would, as I mentioned in the commit comment, be a more adventurous undertaking. It\u0027s also one of those cases I mentioned in the comment in bugzilla: I haven\u0027t figured out yet why we have nodes/diffs for such trees at all. I see where they\u0027re coming from, but I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s intended or whether they do have some purpose somehow or could be safely eliminated.",
