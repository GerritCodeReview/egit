      "message": "I think 5.4.0 match\u003dgreaterOrEqual would be sufficient. We basically only need this one time, to avoid someone gets sources features for not installable binary features (which is not even a problem in the strict sense).\n\nJust declaring the dependency to 5.4 binary already prohibits this. Any matching different from greaterOrEqual would need us to revisit this dependency in the future and to update the number with each new version, without any additional benefit.\n\nI believe 0.0.0 does not have special meaning here, and is really just a version smaller than 0.0.1.",
