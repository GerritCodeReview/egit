Explicit selection seems ok for multi-selection but it feels inconsistent to me that I don\u0027t get the hover toolbar over non-selected elements",

      "message": "Showing the tooltip when there is no selection at all makes no sense since the action would then have no objects to work on.\n\nWhen there is a selection, showing it on elements not selected gives IMO a confusing UI: what does that mean then? It could also mean \"stage the element on which the hover appeared, irrespective of whether or not it\u0027s selected\". Also, if a selection exists but is invisible (user has lots of unstaged files, selects a few at the top, then scrolls down), I find it confusing to have the hover appear and then operate on invisible elements.\n\nWithout the tooltips, you have three clicks: one to select an item, a right click to bring up the context menu, and then a click on a menu entry. With the tooltips, you have two. I don\u0027t think we\u0027d want to go down to one.",

      "message": "In order to see the action name for an action in the hover toolbar I first have to hover over a selected staging entry and then hover over the action displayed, then I get a tooltip with the action name layered on top of the action button. Could we instead show the action name of actions in the hover toolbar just next to the action icon instead of having a tooltip on the toolbar action. Effectively this would yield a filtered context menu which is opened by hovering over an entry instead of right-clicking a selected entry.",

Especially since normal context menus are platform-specific, so the look-and-feel will end up different.\n\nPerhaps I can re-use a menu and make it appear automatically, but I\u0027m not sure I can make it disappear automatically...\n\nAs I said, I\u0027ll have to try.",
