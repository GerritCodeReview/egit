      "message": "We shouldn\u0027t have an ordinal. An ordinal implies some kind of total ordering over all the elements, which we can\u0027t guarantee. For example, if I want to add a new Protocol \u0027pigeon\u0027 I\u0027m going to give it MAX+1 (which is 8 in this case). But if someone else wants to add \u0027avian\u0027 (also as 8) we now have a clash. It gets worse if the next version of (E/J)Git comes out with \u0027psychic (8)\u0027 we now have a duplicate (or triplicate).\n\nThe ordinal appears to add no value at all; we can impose a total ordering over the protocol using the lexicographic sorting of the protocol names; instead of using an ArrayList, we can use a TreeMap instead.\n\nLastly, the value of ordinal appears completely unused.",
