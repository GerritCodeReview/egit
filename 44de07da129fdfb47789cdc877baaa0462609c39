If the current commit is the result of rewriting an earlier incarnation of the same change e.g. using commit -amend or cherry-pick or rebase than the Committed Date is younger than the Authored Date, the latter records the date of the first incarnation of the rewritten commit.\n\nSo if you want to display when the first version of a given commit has been created display date from AuthorIdent, if you want to display when the commit has been last updated then display the date from CommitterIdent.",
