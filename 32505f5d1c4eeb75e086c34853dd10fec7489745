      "message": "I\u0027m not entirely sure about the \"perfect policy\" myself. setUser(false) should be called for everything not triggered by the user, setSystem(true) for everything the user should not even see.\n\nThis job can take quite some time during workbench startup and I think it is nice to see why it is sometimes sluggish during that time. Also the user can actually understand what this job does (in contrast to the tip of the day framework deferring its loading, where I recently set system\u003dtrue because of the user not really understanding that job\u0027s label).\n\nDoes that sound reasonable to you? Otherwise I\u0027m also fine with adding system\u003dtrue.",
