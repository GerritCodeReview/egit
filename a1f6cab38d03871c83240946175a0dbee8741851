      "message": "@Matthias: before you dive too deeply into the JGit apply series (thanks a lot for taking a look there!), could you maybe give some feedback on this particular point? Returning the zero ID for items in the index makes for a simple to use API and was the first idea I had, but I\u0027m not completely comfortable with it. Yet I don\u0027t see a cleaner alternative that would be equally easy to use... Would such an API be OK with you? API interface is at [1].\n\nI\u0027d like to get this API merged in EGit before M3 so that the diffmerge people have at least some time before the release to update \u0026 re-test their code.\n\n(See bug 572802 for where this whole API idea is coming from.)\n\n[1] https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/egit/egit/+/179426/3/org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/info/GitInfo.java#58",
