      "message": "Why? I did think about doing so and in the end decided against it. The ssh part below also doesn\u0027t do so.\n\nMy reasoning for not logging it is:\n* since we just cloned successfully, it shouldn\u0027t happen.\n* if it happens and the server is a Gerrit, it\u0027s most likely a transient thing (like the timeout in the bug report).\n* if it\u0027s not a Gerrit, the user will get a spurious warning.\n* the user can re-try later through the Gerrit Configuration wizard.\n\nWhat would be your reasons for logging here?",
