Normally, you can add them both via the commit dialog by clicking the check boxes, but since you have uploaded this already, you can not use the check box for the change id (as it would create a new id) but should add it by copy/paste the change id from this change. Wen you upload again, you should get a second patch set with the commit message updated.",
