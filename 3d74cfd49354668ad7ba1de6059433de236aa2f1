Instead you would write something like \"Remove deadlock during clones of multiple repositories\".\n\nI\u0027m really not trying to be picky about this, it is just about a general level of consistency and readability when other developers and users are looking at the changes being made.\n\nI do appreciate you contributing this change and I believe that the fix you submitted should be applied.",
