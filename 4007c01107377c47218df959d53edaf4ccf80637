      "message": "That sounds perfectly reasonable (and I was not even aware of this aspect of creating many images). However, for using a LocalResourceManager I would need some hook to dispose that, right? This class is not derived from controls or widgets, therefore there is no dispose() method. I guess that\u0027s the reason why another image is also registered via the utility class in line 103.\n\nIf you have some advice how to use a LocalResourceManager under those circumstances, I\u0027m happy to change the code. I just don\u0027t know how to make it work.",
