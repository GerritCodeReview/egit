      "message": "It looks a bit strange to return rather null than the pereferredMergeStrategy_Default here, if this is actually what has also been stored in either DefaultScope or InstanceScope.\n\nI figure, this is to cause the callers (i.e., the git operations) to fall back to JGit\u0027s default operation. But wouldn\u0027t it be more clear, if this method would return the JGit default key instead and let the git operations than act accordingly, if this is returned rather than null?",

      "message": "The problem here is that there is not ONE default JGit key.\nThe meaning here is to let JGit use its default strategy for the command being invoked. It is up to JGit to decide which is the right default strategy depending on what it\u0027s doing, it\u0027s not up to JGit to know that, and thus we cannot return one default here IMHO.\nWe would otherwise assume that JGit uses the same default for merge and rebase and cherry-pick and so on, plus we would also assume that EGit has to know what this default is.\nThe only way I found to let the JGit default take place is to return null here.",

      "message": "Yes, I see. What I meant was that it would be more clear if the Activator returns a dedicated MergeStrategy indicating that JGit should decide and the EGit operations, such as RebaseOperation, understand this \"let JGit choose\" strategy and set the strategy to null.\n\nIdeally, this knowledge about the handling of the \"let JGit choose strategy\" would be encapsulated in a merge strategy provider so that the EGit operations just call command.setStrategy(mergeStrategyProvider.getStrategy()) and the merge strategy provider knows that it should ask Activator.getPreferredMergeStrategy and that it should return null if the \"let JGit choose strategy\" is in place.\n\nAnyway, this is just a nitpick. A comment would probably be sufficient around line 268 to explain this strange looking condition.",
