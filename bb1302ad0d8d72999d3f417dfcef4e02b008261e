While it does fix comparing non-workspace Xtext resources by ensuring the right Xtext document provider is found by the framework, it now confuses the TextFileDocumentProvider, resulting in a CoreException being logged. Though comparisons seem to work, concurrent editing is not detected. Yuck. Looks like this needs still more work.",
