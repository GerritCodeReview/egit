Right now static run() calls instance execute, and static execute() calls instance run.\n\nAnd to avoid that confusion, would it eventually be possible to name the 2 methods identically? Or does that confuse the compiler?\n\nBTW: The class looks even better than I had thought when describing the lambda idea.",
