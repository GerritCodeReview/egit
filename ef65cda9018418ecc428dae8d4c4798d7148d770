I was recently wondering about that when I accidentially checked out an unwanted very branch and could not stop that operation for several minutes (where most of the time was probably spent in the check which projects to close).\nHowever, we can do that in a separate change, if you agree.",

Though TreeWalks are surprisingly fast in my experience.\n\nWhen there are several repositories, we should probably make sure that the combined result dialog shows the correct information (some repos done, one canceled, others not_attempted).",
