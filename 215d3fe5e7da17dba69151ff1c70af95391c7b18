      "message": "I think this is wrong, we should return MergeResult since it also contains the information which merge failed which would be useful to make the displayed dialogs more useful, e.g. if merge fails due to a conflict we should show the 2 branches we tried to merge since this is important information. The code receiving this MergeResult can still extract the merge status and take decisions based on that.",
