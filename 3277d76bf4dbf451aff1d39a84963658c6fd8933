Then for the first repository cloned from a given host auto-fill wouldn\u0027t be triggered but for all subsequent repositories cloned from the same host auto-fill would be used. This way we could reduce chances for false-positives and still provide auto-fill for the very common case that a given git server typically hosts many repositories and users often clone multiple repos from the same server.",

      "message": "OK, valid use case. I wonder if going through all repositories\u0027 configs and reading their remotes (and submodules) is feasible -- yes, the config is cached, but (a) it might not yet be, and (b) bug 484795 has shown that even getting the last-modified time may be expensive. So that approach might lead to a noticeable delay until the dialog comes up.",
