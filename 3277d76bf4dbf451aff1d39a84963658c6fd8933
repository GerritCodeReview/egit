Then for the first repository cloned from a given host auto-fill wouldn\u0027t be triggered but for all subsequent repositories cloned from the same host auto-fill would be used. This way we could reduce chances for false-positives and still provide auto-fill for the very common case that a given git server typically hosts many repositories and users often clone multiple repos from the same server.",
