      "message": "I don\u0027t really know what kind of exotic file systems have what kinds of access restrictions. Therefore I would not assume that I get a valid list() after a successful call of isDirectory().\n\nFor this specific piece of code I also cannot imagine that this would really be a problem. Nevertheless I\u0027d rather add one more null check for clarity than trying to suppress a warning here (which would be even harder, given it is not the compiler, but spotbugs). Or did I get you wrong about the warning?",
