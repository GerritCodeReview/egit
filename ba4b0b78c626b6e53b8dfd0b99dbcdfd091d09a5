      "message": "BTW (unrelated to this change): there are menu items and preferences for \"wrap\" and \"fill paragraphs\". However, I don\u0027t see any implementation for \"wrap\", and \"fill\" is IMO not useful without soft-wrap as it just turns every paragraph into a single long line, which doesn\u0027t strike me as user-friendly.\n\nWhat\u0027s up with these two features? Is anybody planning on completing them, or should they be simply removed?",
