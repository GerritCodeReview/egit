This case is still not handled by the GitMoveDeleteHook. \n\nIt should work if you rename a project that is not located in the default location.",

In this case the location does not change. \n\nThis error had been there before. I think it is the same as was reported in comment 2 of bug 334112. Mabe we could fix it in another change, but you could mention it in the commit message as a further limitation.",
