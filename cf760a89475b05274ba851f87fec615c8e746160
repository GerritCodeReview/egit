      "message": "I didn\u0027t mean to say we shouldn\u0027t use the RepositoryCache. I think it makes sense. I just didn\u0027t like the early exit, because the operation clearly tries to make sure that all items in the selection belong to the same repository. Your later change is good; like it very much.",

I mean, we should *always* use the else branch, because it will make sure the *dedicated* change event will be sent for a single path and not for the entire repository.\n\nThis is of course not caused by your change, but I wonder if we should better always use the \"else\" branch.",
