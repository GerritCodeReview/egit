      "message": "I don\u0027t know if or why it would help. All I know is that the sibling \"assertCommitAfterBase\" uses the same wait and that in many builds the bot wait condition is not met and always in \"assertNoCommit.\n\nAt least in one instance (when I added a plugin.xml change) the build of _this_ gerrit change failed and after the job wait was added it succeeded. The change seems not to hurt and in the best case the problem of \"strange\" build failures is solved.",
