Once we tell that model to remove a repo, the two caches should just update themselves.\n\nHowever, what I like here is the repository.close() -- that is indeed needed. Except that now repositories are closed twice if delete \u003d\u003d true. And we know (change I66aadc9) that can be problematic.",
