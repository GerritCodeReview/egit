I first tried to maintain it as a shared Google document but the table formatting didn\u0027t really work so I maintain this in a local powerpoint :( Still it\u0027s a manually maintained coarse table which doesn\u0027t rely on technical checks. There was a GSoC project to improve this but the student failed to create any useful results :(",
