Still the History View, the Team menu, the Compare With and Replace With menu, the toolbar buttons, the reflog view and the decorators are still not connected to the submodule repository. And I am sure I forgot something. \n\nI am not sure if all these other places can simply be changed in the same way as the Staging View. I am not sure if the concept of the RepositoryMapping would still be suited if we had more than one repository per project.",

If we\u0027d change all these places to use getRepository(IResource res) do a submodule walk in case there are submodules we may get a performance penalty.",
