They are used as default command names, overriden in plugin.xml by explicit label directives on the menu commands that then use DeleteBranchMenu.label and RenameBranchMenu.label.\n\nThe only place the default would perhaps be used might have been the legacy DeleteBranchAction and RenameBranchAction, but those appear to be unused?\n\nThe repository view uses a different command ID (org.eclipse.ui.edit.delete), a different label (RepoViewDeleteBranch.label), and a different handler (org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.repository.tree.command.DeleteBranchCommand) and should not have the \"...\" anyway since it doesn\u0027t always ask for confirmation.",
