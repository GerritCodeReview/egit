      "message": "We tried hard to avoid most arbitrary waits from our tests. (I know there\u0027s still quite a few, and the various joinJobs or similar operations contains some themselves.)\n\nLooking at that FILL_TAG_LIST job, I think this job should work differently:\n\n1. It must return Job.ASYNC_FINISH.\n2. It must call done(Status.OK_STATUS) from within the asyncExec runnable (in a try-finally).\n\nUnfortunately this pattern of \"run normal job, perform asyncExec, return OK_STATUS\" is fairly common in EGit, but it\u0027s wrong and makes testing a nightmare.\n\nAnother approach is to use a normal job and a job change listener that then schedules a UIJob or WorkbenchJob, but for testing that probably also would need to have a family.",
