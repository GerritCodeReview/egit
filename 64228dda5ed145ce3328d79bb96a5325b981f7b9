      "message": "The key you use should be mentioned in the commit message.\n\nI like this approach, because its similar to the commit-msg hook that Gerrit comes with; you install it in your repository and it always updates your commits.  The downside is, the hook fires even if you don\u0027t want a Change-Id in your message.\n\nBut I\u0027m not sure that is a problem.  I think if your upstream is using Gerrit Code Review, you probably just always want the Change-Id automatically inserted in any commit you make in this repository.  At least that\u0027s my use case.  :-)",
