      "message": "I understand the CopyOnWriteList to simplify the copy-and-iterate to a simple iterate. For the SafeRunner, do you mean to basically not provide a logging message, and just let the exception itself be logged by the runner? I have seen some places doing it like this in egit.\n\nIf that understanding is right, I will create another change with that refactoring and rebase this one onto it.",

      "message": "That\u0027s exactly what I meant. I see no need to provide a translation for what is really a technical internal error the user cannot do anything about. Besides, the code will become much simpler.\n\nSafeRunner will also log the exception, and that\u0027s all that counts here. If I get a localized exception message in Japanese in the log or in an AERI report for this, it won\u0027t help me one yota. And it won\u0027t help the (Japanese :-)) user either since he\u0027s unlikely to know what an IndexDiffChangedListener is, and anyway the stack trace will show the IndexDiffCacheEntry, so we\u0027ll know where this comes from.",
