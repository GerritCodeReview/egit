      "message": "I know, this looks weird.\n\nThe model descriptor provided in EGit UI will not behave as intended when it receives a remote mapping context.\nBasically, it would break the test case where you select a project and compare it with another version: If there are changes in other projects, these changes would now appear in the comparison, which is not what we want.\nBut on the other hand, we do need a RemoteMappingContext in EMFCompare for example to check whether certain files that are not locally present must be included in the logical model. If locally I have only model.uml whereas remotely I have model.uml + submodel.uml, I need a RemoteMappingContext to discover it.\n\nI couldn\u0027t find any simple way around that other than ignoring the EGit model provider here.\n\nThe only way around that I can think of would be to introduce in EGit an interface that ModelProviders could adapt to so that we could only provide a RemoteMappingContext to those ModelProviders that explicitely declare it. We could then make sure that the EMFModelProvider would adapt to this interface.\nDo you think it\u0027d be a better solution?",
