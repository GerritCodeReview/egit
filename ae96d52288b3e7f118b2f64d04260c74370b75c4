      "message": "Now there\u0027s another problem relating to filters. This applies the action to all files, even filtered out ones. Stage/unstage applies only to visible nodes. We should be consistent.\n\nTo see what I mean: have a test project with a folder foo containing two files A.txt and B.txt. Modify both. Enter \"foo/A\" in the filter box in the staging view\u0027s toolbar with Compact Tree View enabled. There should be only foo/A.txt visible in the unstaged viewer. Now choose \"Untrack\". Staged viewer shows deletion of foo/A.txt. Now clear the filter text in the toolbar. Oops, foo/B.txt also got removed from the index.\n\nLooking at stage(), I see it uses contentProvider.getStagingEntriesFiltered() to get the children of a StagingFolderEntry. I think that should be done here, too.\n\n(I also see that stage() has a funny \"if StagingEntry {} else if StagingFolderEntry {} else {}\" structure. I wonder what that else-branch could be good for... might be a leftover from old code. AFAIK we only have StagingEntry or StagingFolderEntry elements in that tree. unstage() doesn\u0027t have a corresponding else part either. Looks like some more clean-up and duplicate code unification would be needed here; but maybe in a later commit.)",
