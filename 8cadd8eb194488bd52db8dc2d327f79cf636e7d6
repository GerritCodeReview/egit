So why not remove all this,including the key in UIText and the text in the uitext.properties?\n\nI see no reason to keep on dragging obsolete code around. Or do you see any way this could occur? Even if it could, I doubt a log entry will be useful here.",

      "message": "I just wasn\u0027t sure what your policy is for that. Do the smallest change possible to fix the problem or include cleanups as well, this sometimes depends on which project I submit a patch to. Will create new patch set.\n\nRegarding the API problem from patchset 1, how can I actually avoid using a bad method? The Oomph setup automatically sets the egit-4.6 target platform and the API baseline tooling only checks about versioning issues against the previously released version. What am I missing in the automated tooling to assure that the code is compatible to Luna?",
