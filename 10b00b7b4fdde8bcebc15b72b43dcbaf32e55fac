      "message": "That might hide a bug. A Job _always_ must return an IStatus, so we should never have null here. Besides, we don\u0027t really know whether commitJob or commitJob.getResult() was null -- both would be equally puzzling.\n\nWe should know what\u0027s in the Eclipse log of the user\u0027s Eclipse who sent this AERI report. I suspect there was an earlier exception somewhere.\n\nIt might be safer not to use commitJob.getResult() but event.getResult() instead. commitJob then also doesn\u0027t need to be final.",
