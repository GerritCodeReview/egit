      "message": "Adding 0xFF in front doesn\u0027t seem to make sense. I notice that with \"file names first\" I get\n\n  missing - some/sub\n  missing - some/sub/dir\n\nbut with \"file names first\" off I get first all files in some/sub/dir and then all those in some/sub (which I personally find strange, but it\u0027s what \"git status\" also shows, so it\u0027s OK).\n\nAlso, what\u0027s the desired order if I also have\n\n  missing\n  missing - some/suba\n  missing - some/subškoda\n  missing - some/sub/škoda\n\nI have the feeling that one can\u0027t get a consistent ordering with more \"magic\" characters. Perhaps use the category also for alphabetic sort? (I don\u0027t care whether some/sub comes before some/sub/dir or the other way around. But some/suba should not come in between?)",
