      "message": "Progress reporting is wrong. \"progress\" has just two ticks, the second tick needs to be redistributed before the loop into toRefresh.size() ticks.\n\nOf course, the question is if we need an IProgressMonitor at all. It\u0027s always called with a NullProgressMonitor, so it doesn\u0027t report progress and cannot be canceled.\n\nWhen it was run in a job having a progress monitor made sense, but now?",
