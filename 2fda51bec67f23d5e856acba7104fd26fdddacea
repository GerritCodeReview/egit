      "message": "I think this code should be in JGit. What you suggest is a \"git checkout -- \u003cpath\u003e\", right? That\u0027s pure git logic and we should try to  keep such things in JGit. A good place for that would be in  CheckoutCommand. If we would add a method \"addPath(String path)\" there then we could move this code to the right location. Then other user\u0027s of the JGit API could make use of this code.\n\nSorry, I know I am late with this comment - and I was about to let commit this change and refactor it directly afterwards. But: officially copying code from EGit to JGit is because of the licenses not so easy.\nSo better put the code right now.",
