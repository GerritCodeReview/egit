      "message": "The logic for identical Strings is now spread over 2 places in the method. As an alternative, one could simply put a guard like condition at the beginning of the method to make it easier to read:\n\nif (o1.compareToIgnoreCase(o2)) \u003d\u003d 0)\n    return 0;\n\nHowever, I\u0027m not sure if that brings a runtime penalty compared to your version.\n\nTotally unrelated to your change: o1 and o2 should be s1 and s2, or even more descriptive names. :)",
