So in a way it belongs in here; without inline renaming one doesn\u0027t really need to fix the equals/hashcode/sorting.\n\nSame with the paste. If one doesn\u0027t have an editor in this view there\u0027s no need to refactor the paste.\n\nDon\u0027t know when I\u0027ll have the time to split this.",
