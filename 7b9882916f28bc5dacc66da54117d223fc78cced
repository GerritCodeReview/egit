      "message": "Calling isIgnoredInOldIndex() for files could be still expensive (will split paths for each file and do in worst case filesInDelta * path.segmentsCount() lookups).\n\nBefore returning false or true here we could collect *known* ignored/not ignored directories state in the temporary map (key \u003d path, value \u003d boolean) and so remember the \"known\" path state there, saving us the lookup.\n\nFor files which are located in the same directory structure the lookup will be fast because the map will contain already all parents after first \"while\" round.\n\nAt the end we will have something like filesInDelta*2 + max (segmentsCount()) lookups for files from the same tree.",

      "message": "Hm, I know what you mean. I\u0027m not sure whether this wouldn\u0027t cause more overhead than it would shove off the times. The visitor is re-created for every resource change event. It could potentially be a lot of resources, yes, but it\u0027s just as common that it\u0027s only a few. This code is not sooo expensive, I think.\n\nStill I can give it a try if you insist.",
